function solo_frangi(ima,ln,file_name)
% SOLO_FRANGI(IMA, LN, file_name), returns a raw image which is frangi enhanced. 
%   It applies the frangi filter, where the frangi filter function is realized using the source code from Dirk-Jan Kroon (2010) 
%   (see http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/24409-hessian-based-frangi-vesselness-filter). Files for frangi filter funciton are included in ./frangi_filter_version2a/ 
%
%   IMA.  A string of the image's filename. If the image is not in the current folder, or in a folder on the MATLABÂ® path,
%   specify the full pathname. 
%
%   LN.  A scalar that tells the number of frames in the image.
%
%   FILE_NAME. A string of the image's filename, but without the file
%   extension and the folder path.
%   
%   Examples for usage, see the demo.m
%
%   Function is written by Z.Xu Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona (Dec. 2014)
