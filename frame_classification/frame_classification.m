function ln1 = frame_classification(ima_after_frangi, ln)
% FRAME_CLASSIFICATION(IMA_AFTER_FRANGI, LN), returns a value LN1 representing the number of frames of the preperfusion phase in the coronary angiogram.
%
%   IMA_AFTER_FRANGI.  A string of the image's filename. This image is the enhanced image got from the result of function SOLO_FRANGI. If the image is not in the current folder, or in a folder on the MATLABÂ® path,
%   specify the full pathname. 
%
%   LN.  A scalar that tells the number of total frames in the image.

%   Examples for usage, see the demo.m
